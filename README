Use this script to improve readability to your string formatting. Based off of C#'s String.Format method.

Example usages:

	console.log("Hi {0}, I'm {1}. How are you, {0}? {2}!".$format("Chris", "swell", "sweet"));
	
	console.log("Hi {0}.".$format("Chris"));
	
	console.log("I'm {mood}. How are you, {name}? Hope you're {hope}!".$format({
		name: "Chris",
		mood: "swell",
		hope: "rockn n rollin"
	}));

	var question = "What does the {noun1} know that the {noun2} doesn't?";
	
	console.log(question.$format({
		noun1: "nose",
		noun2: "mustache"
	}));
